      <p class="pt-5"> The Chi Alpha Chapter of Omega Psi Phi Fraternity Inc, was founded on Whitworth College (now Whitworth University) in Spokane, WA on December 6th, 1980. The founders were Brother Sam Baynes (4th District, Xi Theta 71’), Brother Thomas Franklin (4th District, Psi Omicron 69’), Brother Rudy Boone Jr. (6th District, Mu Psi 71’), and Brother Richard Williams (12th District, Sigma Iota 60’).
	  </p>

      <p>These men were brought together by of their employer at the time, Kaiser. It was then that they formed bonds and began to become noticeable to others in the community. As the four began getting interest from men at work and in the community, they felt a chapter was needed in Spokane to fulfill those asperations. Brother Franklin at the time knew members of Zeta Upsilon Chapter in Seattle, WA; and reached out to them for assistance with paperwork and process of starting a chapter.
	  </p>

	  <p>Due to the founders not being members of any chapter in the state of Washington, the charter line had to cross under Zeta Upsilon. This line (Six Men of Light) consisted of: Billy Morris Sr, Leon “Skip” Roland, Jack Hall, John Steele, William Fountain and the lone undergrad Fredrick Douglas Mitchell (Spokane Falls Community College). His father was O.L. Mitchell, a member of Zeta Upsilon Chapter and knew Brother Franklin.

	  </p>

	  <p>On December 6th, 1980 Chi Alpha Alpha Chapter was formed. The Charter line “6 Men A Like” crossed and Grand Basileus Burnel E. Coulon, came to Spokane Washington to officially charter Chi Alpha Alpha as an Intermediate Chapter (now Graduate) on the scrolls of Omega. This event was held at Whitworth College, because Brother Thomas Franklin’s wife worked there, and she got a 50% discount on the room. Hence why Chi Alpha Alpha Chapter is listed as being founded on the campus of Whitworth College in Spokane, WA.

	  </p>

      <p> Chi Alpha Alpha Chapter was now making a bigger presence and name for its self in the Spokane community. They would travel to the westside of the state and fellowship with the Brothers over there, but really didn’t have any activity on the surrounding college campuses on the eastside of the state. It wasn’t until the lone undergrad of the charter line, Brother Fredrick Douglas Mitchell transferred to Washington State University. Here he met other members of the fraternity who were attending grad school, William Covington (Phi Omicron 77’) and Elias Gaillard (Xi Psi 71’). They begin forming a bond garnering interest from the student body. Brother Mitchell then requested permission from the founders to pledge the first chapter line (All n All) consisting of: Billy Morris Jr., Cephus Martin, William Dowdell and Gary Milton. The ended up crossing the burning sands in the spring of 1981, in which Brother Mitchell was the Dean.

	  </p>
	  
	  <p>Chi Alpha Alpha continued to flourish and bring new members into the fold through 1985. There was a period of 3 years were the chapter didn’t hold any membership activities until Chris Moton crossed spring on 1988. His fresh presence recharged the Chapter in many for years to come. There were other members of Omega who made a big impact in the history of Chi Alpha Alpha, either through working in the area or attending graduate school at one of the many schools the chapter has jurisdiction over. Some of those names consist of Brother James Hasty (Zeta Upsilon 85’), Brother Johnny Jones (Beta Theta 94’) and Brother Tommy Rosser (Upsilon Gamma 82’).

	  </p>
	  
	  <p>Chi Alpha Alpha has brought many men of high standards and distinction into Omega from various campuses, ranging from Central Washington University, Tri-Cities area, Eastern Washington University, Spokane area, Washington State University, University of Idaho and to Idaho State University. It is without a doubt that the chapter will continue this trend.......LONG LIVE XAA!
